1)  JSON for interactions/ communication =>`I've used JSON interation to send data to the db by API and it is implemented by created a JSON field in the        database so we can send data to the JSON and that JSON field reflect the data to that table's fields base on JSON KEY `

2)  Use Swagger to list all your APIs => `I've used swagger inspector extension in Chrome to test and list all api's and created the Collection's api and      I've also used postman for same functionality `

3)  Using user token authentication for API access =>` I've Used JasonWebToekn to generate Authentication token first i'd install the dependancy of JWT        then I've implement the features by seeing it's official documentation and some tutorials`

>plus points NotCompleted

1)  Use SQLite to store all the data => `I've used MySQL Instead of it cause I'm comfortable in it and knew how to use it I've seen sqlite3 documentation      and try to implemented it but I prefered to use MYSQL because I can see the effected tables easily every time I hit the API`

2)  Use unit tests to validate the APIs => `I've tried to implement it using jest and learned how to test fucntion but didn't use it with API I'm still        trying to implement it `

Run API-Express-Demo module using => first use command `npm install to create node_modules` then use command `nodemon index.js`
>
To Test => `I've used manual testing to test API using Swagger and Postman`
>To Deploy => `Create a repository named API-Express-Demo then I'd cloned it to my system and write my code then add all files using {git add .} and then commit my changes using {git commit -m"message"} the push my repository using {git push} `
